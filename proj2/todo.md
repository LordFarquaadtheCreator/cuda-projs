# TODO
- [x] Implement `haversine_distance` function in `haversine_library.cu`
- [ ] Modify `haversine_distance` using provided `calc_time(...)` function to measure runtimes of 
    - [x] GPU memory allocation
    - [x] CPU -> GPU data transfer
    - [x] runnin gthe kernel
    - [x] GPU -> CPU data transfer
- [x] run `test_3cities.py` to verify assertion passes
- [x] download 12 months of 2019 TLC yellow cab data
- [x] filter out start and end locations that are NOT in NYC 
- [x] combine the dataframes into a single large dataframe
- [x] convert `[Start_Lon, Start_Lat, End_Lon, End_Lat]` columns to numpy arrays
- [x] call the previously made haversine function on the arrays to find the distance between each pickup and dropoff
- [x] re-implement haversine distance function in python
    - [x] apply python haversine to the numpy arrays 
    - [x] measure runtime compared to the cuda code we wrote earlier
- [ ] (bonus) create histograms using matplotlib
